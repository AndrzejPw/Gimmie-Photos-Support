## Gimmie Photos Support Page

We made Gimmie Photos for pro photographers to make tedious task of copying photos choosen by their clients easier. We hope you can save some time using our app just like Radek Świątkowski, who invented idea of this app, does. For him it meant more time on editing photos like [these](https://www.radekswiatkowski.com).

If you have any problems with the app or would like to suggest any improvements please contacts us:
